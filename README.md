# Blockchain Protocols - Project

## Voting Web Application Based on the MultiversX Blockchain

### Purpose of the Project

This project aims to create a decentralized voting platform using the MultiversX blockchain. The goal is to provide a secure and transparent voting system that eliminates manual vote counting, ensuring trust in the process.

### Needs It Tries to Satisfy

The platform addresses the following needs:
1. **Transparency**: All votes are recorded on the MultiversX blockchain, allowing participants to verify the results independently.
2. **Security**: Blockchain technology ensures that votes cannot be tampered with or altered after submission.
3. **Ease of Use**: A user-friendly interface simplifies the voting process, making it accessible to a wider audience.
4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Using blockchain reduces overhead costs by automating vote recording and tallying.

### Components of the Project
The voting web application includes the following components:

1. **Frontend Interface**:
   - A web interface to:
     - Register users.
     - Allow users to cast their votes.
     - Display results once voting concludes.

2. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Smart contracts on the MultiversX blockchain to:
     - Register eligible voters.
     - Record votes on the blockchain.
     - Automatically tally and publish results.

3. **Administrative Panel**:
   - An interface for administrators to:
     - Set up elections (e.g., candidates, start/end times).
     - Monitor voting progress.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Encryption for data transmission.
   - Voter authentication through unique access codes.
